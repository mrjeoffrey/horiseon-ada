# PROJECT BRIEF

Refactor an SEO landing page that is accessible, legible, and optimized for Search Engine Optimization. Responsibilities include fixing HTML and CSS errors, refactoring code to reduce file size, maintain look&feel of site to provided high fidelity mocks.
  
  

## HTML REFACTORING
I replaced div tags with semantic html tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, cleaned up redundant attributes, implemented WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility such as `aria-labels` and tag ordering, implemented SEO-related attributes in the head for organic search.



## CSS REFACTORING
I consolidated repeated css attributes, reassigned classes to match semantic html, added comments, global styles and component styles for readability. To make this site work with mobile phones, I added a breakpoint and modified css attributes to match accordingly.


## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
Brandname was originally "Horiseon", modified to "HoriSEOn" per client request.
