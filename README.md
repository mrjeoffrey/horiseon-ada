# PROJECT BRIEF

Refactor an SEO landing page that is **accessible**, **legible**, and **optimized** for search engine optimization. Responsibilities include fixing HTML and CSS errors, refactoring code to reduce file size, maintain look&feel of site to provided high fidelity mocks.
  
  

## HTML REFACTORING
I replaced div tags with semantic html tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, cleaned up redundant attributes, implemented WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility such as `aria-labels` and tag ordering, implemented SEO-related attributes in the head for organic search.



## CSS REFACTORING
I consolidated repeated css attributes, reassigned classes to match semantic html, added comments, global styles and component styles for readability. To make this site work with mobile phones, I added a breakpoint and modified css attributes to match accordingly.


## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
Brandname was originally "Horiseon", modified to "HoriSEOn" per client request.
